# python-refresher

completed get_column() function in my_utils.py code.

In print_filres.py code:
- changed country_columns = 1 to country_columns = 0.
This was done because 'Area' data is stored in first column, indexed from zero in Agrofood_co2_emmisions.csv.
- updated variavle name fires_column to forestFires_column.
This is done bacause there are two columns in Agrofood_co2_emmisions.csv that track fire data; Savana fires and Forest fires. The original fires_column = 4 corresponds to the Forest fire column in the dataset.
